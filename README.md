# TV-Script-Generation-DeepLearning-ND-Udacity
This the third project in the Deep Learning Nanodegree programm at Udacity.
The aim is to create a LSTM-RNN for text generation.
The neural network is trained with the scripts (dialogues) of all seasons of Seinfeld, a popular sitcom from the 1990s. After training, the network is able to generate dialogues, by setting a starting word and the length of the text to be generated!
